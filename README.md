# Duet Switch Tester

![Cover image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai03-2725/duet-switch-tester/main/images/cover.jpg)

A switch tester intended for use at events and storefronts.  
Displays two of each switch - one with a keycap for testing the keyfeel, and another without a keycap to show off the visuals.  
Can be assembled with a functioning PCB to pair the tester to a kiosk device for additional information display purposes.  


## Features
- FR4 sandwich case
- Designed to look visually balanced with the left column of each cluster having keycaps installed
- Fully hotswap PCB powered by a RP2040
- Roughly 1800-size to balance display quantity with practicality and shipping/transport constraints

- 1x Plate
- 1x Bottom panel
- 8x M2x8 Spacers
